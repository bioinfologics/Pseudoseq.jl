Actually, we&#39;d run several of the molecules from our perfect universe through the sequencer, and use those  reads to form a consensus that eliminates any mistakes a sequencer machine might make - no technology is completely error proof after all and all detection equipment has a certain rate of error.</p><p>Sadly, we don&#39;t have such an amazing sequencer technology that allows the reading of a chromosome in its entirety. Instead, shorter reads are taken of shorter fragments of DNA (even long read technology uses fragments and produces reads, much shorter than the full size of a chromosome molecule).</p><p>A common step in any DNA sequencing experiment, therefore, is to fragment or shear the DNA molecules that are present in the sample.</p><p>Therefore, a common step in any sequencing experiment simulation constructed with <code>Pseudoseq</code> is to fragment the DNA molecules in a universe into smaller ones.</p><p>This is achieved with the <code>fragment</code> method. <code>fragment</code> is one of the universe transformations briefly mentioned in the introduction.

So <code>Pseudoseq</code> provides a function to <code>subsample</code> a <code>Universe</code> of DNA fragments.</p><p>This is done with the sample function:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">subsampled_universe = subsample(cut_universe, 463967)</code></pre><p>Where the second numeric argument (463967) is the number of molecules you want to sample.</p><p>Each fragment in the universe is as likely to be sampled as any other. Fragments are sampled without replacement.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Determining-the-number-of-fragments-to-sample-1" href="#Determining-the-number-of-fragments-to-sample-1">Determining the number of fragments to sample</a></h3><p>But how did I get to the number 463967?</p><p>Prior to sampling, there is a universe of 33139992 DNA fragments, of on average 700bp in length. There is variation - some fragments are bigger, some are smaller.</p><p>We can estimate how often a base position in the genome is represented in this universe of ~700bp fragments with a simple formula:</p><div>\[C = \frac{LN}{G}\]</div><p>Where <code>C</code> is the expected coverage, <code>L</code> is the average length of the fragments, and <code>N</code> is the number of fragments, and <code>G</code> is the number of bases in the genome.</p><p>Given that <code>L = 700</code>, <code>N = 33139992</code>, and <code>G = 4639675</code>:</p><div>\[C = \frac{700 \times 33139992}{4639675}\]</div><p>The answer is ~5000, so each base in the genome is represented 5000 times  (give or take) in the universe. This makes sense, because if you recall how we created our universe.....</p><pre><code class="language-julia">universe = makeuniverse(&quot;mygenome.fasta&quot;, 5000)</code></pre><p>.....we started with 5000 copies of the genome!</p><p>Ok, so say I wanted to subsample the universe such that each base position in the genome is represented ~50 times. That is, I want to achieve 50x coverage, you can determine the number of fragments to subsample from the universe, by reversing the formula:</p><div>\[N = \frac{CG}{L}\]</div><div>\[N = \frac{50 \times 4639675}{700}\]</div><p>The answer is 331405, so if I sample 331405 700bp fragments, from my universe of 33139992 700bp fragments. I can expect that subsample to represent each base in the genome approximately 50 times.</p><p>But wait! It&#39;s not quite a simple as that! The answer of 331405 would be correct if we were to just pull those 700bp fragments out of the universe, and then sequence a complete read of each 700bp fragment in the subsample in its entirety.</p><p>However, that&#39;s not what happens, even in long read sequencers. Rather some sub-stretch of the fragment is read by the sequencer, and in the case of paired end sequencing, a two sub-stretches of each fragment are read by the sequencer: one from each end of the fragment:</p><pre><code class="language-none">Read 1

expected_coverage = 50
read_length = 250

N = needed_sample_size(expected_coverage, genome_size, readlength)
